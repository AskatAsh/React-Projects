# React Donation Campaign

This Project is made using react. I used react router, react recharts, localstorage, javascript, tailwind and css to complete this project.

There are many features in this project, such as :

- [@src/Components/Navbar/Navbar.jsx](https://github.com/programming-hero-web-course-4/b8a8-donation-campaign-AskatAsh/blob/main/src/Components/Navbar/Navbar.jsx) I used [useLocation]() hook for giving background overley.

- [@src/Utilities/LocalStorage.js](https://github.com/programming-hero-web-course-4/b8a8-donation-campaign-AskatAsh/blob/main/src/Utilities/LocalStorage.js) I used [localStorage]() with vanilla javascript to store donated data.

- [@src/Utilities/SumOfDonations.js](https://github.com/programming-hero-web-course-4/b8a8-donation-campaign-AskatAsh/blob/main/src/Utilities/SumOfDonations.js) I also used [localStorage]() to store total donations and user donated data separately.

- [@src/Components/Statistics/Statistics.jsx](https://github.com/programming-hero-web-course-4/b8a8-donation-campaign-AskatAsh/blob/main/src/Components/Statistics/Statistics.jsx) I used simple **Pie Chart** from [react recharts]() to show total donation vs user donated data in percentage.

- [@src/Components/Banner/Banner.jsx](https://github.com/programming-hero-web-course-4/b8a8-donation-campaign-AskatAsh/blob/main/src/Components/Banner/Banner.jsx) I used [onSubmit method]() to get search data and show category cards based on that.

- [@src/main.jsx](https://github.com/programming-hero-web-course-4/b8a8-donation-campaign-AskatAsh/blob/main/src/main.jsx) I used [react router]() to make navigation without page loading.

- [@src/Components/Donations/Donations.jsx](https://github.com/programming-hero-web-course-4/b8a8-donation-campaign-AskatAsh/blob/main/src/Components/Donations/Donations.jsx) I added a [see all]() button in donations route which displays all donated data on click.
